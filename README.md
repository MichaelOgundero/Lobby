Rovshan


1- create a fully working version on memory
2- create version that workes on local  MS Sql
3- create the HttpServlet part and upload to Google change boolean return opeations to error string 
4- fix the MS-Sql on Google
5- push to github
6- create a documentation


PS for step 3 boolean to eroor string change only chage the fucntions that you will use
for the HttpServlet  because other internal details doesnt matter

Notes
