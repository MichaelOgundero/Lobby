# Lobby
the lobby for the strategy game
Rovshan


1- create a fully working version on memory
2- create version that works on local  MS Sql
3- create the HttpServlet part and upload to Google change boolean return operations to error string 
4- fix the MS-Sql on Google
5- push to GitHub
6- create a documentation


PS for step 3 boolean to error string change only change the functions that you will use
for the HttpServlet  because other internal details doesnâ€™t matter

Notes 
GameID == 0  means the user is in no Gamelobby can only be at MainLobby 


json format data usage complete servlet management and Ms sql persistance needed



IN the next release I will prove documentation on the types of the files and also Json keys in the responses of all requests
